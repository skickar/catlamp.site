// vet-protocols.js — "Diagnose my cat": per-board exam protocols for vetprobe.js.
//
// Everything a protocol asserts is something the ROM loader can observe on a bare board
// with no firmware: what each GPIO rests at with only the chip's internal pulls (external
// pull-ups, parts driving the pin, nothing at all), which module pins sit next to each
// other (solder bridges), which radio should answer over SPI, which I2C bus should carry
// pull-ups. Expectations are written against the board's KiCad netlist and, where we have
// them, against measured units — every line says which.
//
// Pin expectation vocabulary: "HIGH" external pull-up / driven high · "LOW" driven low ·
// "float" nothing attached · "held" driven either way (state-dependent outputs) ·
// "rom" a level the ESP32-S3 ROM itself imposes in download mode (JTAG pins), not the board.

// ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 castellations in physical order (from the netlist's U7 pin numbers),
// strap/USB/UART/power pins included so adjacency is right, then filtered at run time.
